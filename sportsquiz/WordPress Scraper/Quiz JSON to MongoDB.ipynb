       "    'desc': '[expander_maker id=\"2\" more=\"Read more\" less=\"Read less\"]As one of the most low-key superstars that the NBA has ever seen, people might be hard-pressed to figure out who Kawhi Leonard’s closest friends are in the league. Although he had an ugly departure from the San Antonio Spurs, Leonard enjoyed a good rapport with his Toronto Raptors teammates, and he seems to have left on good terms. However, his closest relationship isn’t with them, either. \\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nInstead, Leonard’s best friend is Jeremy Castleberry, a man who, while not a household name in even the most devout NBA circles, has known Leonard since high school. \\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nJeremy Castleberry is an NBA assistant coach who has been with the Raptors and the Spurs alongside Kawhi Leonard. Much like LeBron James, Leonard has always been big on keeping his friends around as he moves teams, and Castleberry has built a solid reputation along the way. The pair first met in high school, where they played as teammates. \\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nThe relationship continued in college, where Castleberry joined Leonard at San Diego State. Leonard was the clear star in the team, but Castleberry made his way to the NBA using a different method than his friend, and the two have been joined at the hip ever since.[/expander_maker]',\n",
