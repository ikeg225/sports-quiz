The Rockets did not blast off right away as they dropped their first two games at home against the St. Louis Hawks on October 14th and 17th, before beating their expansion brother Seattle Supersonics on the road October 20th for their first win.

In the first-ever NBA Finals, the Lakers would win their 3rd straight Championship by beating the Syracuse Nationals in 6 games.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1950\/51: With the NBA reducing to 11 teams, the Lakers continued to dominate winning the Western Division with a 44-24 record.

However, the Lakers signed a promising rookie named Clyde Lovellette, who was more than capable of spelling Mikan, as the Lakers won the Western Division with a 46-26 record. In a first-round, robin the Lakers won 3 straight to face the Rochester Royals in the Western Finals. The Lakers would go on to beat the Royals in a three-game series. In the finals, the Lakers and Syracuse Nationals alternate wins, with Lakers emerging with their 3rd straight title with an 87-80 win in Game 7. Following the season, Mikan would announce his retirement.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1954\/55: The NBA instituted two revolutionary rule changes; the 24-second shot clock was introduced, as was a limit of 6 team fouls per quarter. The new rules accomplished two things: they helped quicken the pace of the action on the court, and they took away the tactical advantage of fouling a player who has possession of the ball late in a game. Despite the rule changes, the Lakers still make the playoffs with a 40-32 record. In the first round, the Lakers would beat the Rochester Royals in 3 games to advance to the Western Finals. However, in the finals, the Lakers would fall to the Fort Wayne Pistons 3 games to 1.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1955\/56: With Jim Pollard retiring, the Lakers were just a shell of themselves, as they struggled all season.

Mikan would not even last the year as he quit midway through the season as John Kundla reassumed the coaching duties.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1958\/59: The Lakers fortunes would quickly turn as they drafted Forward Elgin Baylor with the top draft pick.

However, the Hawks would rally to win the next two games to end the Lakers Championship dreams.

The NBA would not return to Minnesota for another 30 years while the Lakers became one of professional sports\u2019 most successful franchises in Los Angeles.[\/expander_maker]","hint":"","answers":{"w85t8":{"id":"w85t8","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Lincoln Lakers"},"8jk8l":{"id":"8jk8l","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Minneapolis Lakers","isCorrect":"1"},"ekjsc":{"id":"ekjsc","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Butte Jackers"},"ce5x2":{"id":"ce5x2","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Sioux Jackers"}}},"ebn6m":{"id":"ebn6m","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"","image":"","imageId":"","video":"","imagePlaceholder":"","imagePlaceholderId":"","title":"What is the Original Location & Name of the Memphis Grizzlies?","desc":"[expander_maker id=\"2\" more=\"Read more\" less=\"Read less\"]Vancouver Grizzlies (1995-2001)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1995\/96: The NBA and Canada were always a natural match, as James Naismith, the famed inventor of the sports, was a Canadian. However, after the Toronto Huskies folded after the NBA\u2019s first season in 1947, it took nearly 50 years for the NBA to return to the Great White North, as the Vancouver Grizzlies were on of two Canadian teams to join the league in 1995. The Grizzlies would get off to a solid start stunning the Portland Trailblazers on the road 92-80 on November 3rd. Two nights later, the Grizzlies had a successful home debut at General Motors Place by beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 100-98. However, the Grizzlies would lose their next 19 games, as they went on to finish in last place in the Midwestern Division with an NBA worse record of 15-67, as only four Grizzlies averaged ten ppg, with Greg Anthony leading the way with a mediocre 14.0 ppg. The Grizzlies and the NBA\u2019s other Canadian expansion team, the Toronto Raptors would split two games.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1996\/97: The Grizzlies continued to struggle in their second season despite solid play from Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who averaged 18.7 to leave the Grizzlies who again posted the worst record in the NBA at 14-68. However, due to a rule that the Grizzlies could not win the draft lottery, they had no hopes of landing Wake Forrest star Tim Duncan in the draft and instead had to settle for Antonio Daniels, with the fourth overall pick.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1997\/98: The Grizzlies made some strides under new coach Brian Hill as they finally escaped last place by finishing sixth with a record of 19-63. Leading the way in scoring again was Shareef Adur-Rahim, who averaged 22.3 ppg. Also showing promise was Bryant Reeves the Grizzlies first-ever draft pick who continued to show improvement with 16.3 ppg and 7.3 rebounds per game.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1998\/99: Mike Bibby had a solid debut as he posted 13.2 points and 6.5 assists per game and was named to the All-Rookie First Team. Shareef Abdur-Rahim continued to improve posting a career-high 23.0 ppg and 7.5 rpg. However, a knee injury limited Bryant Reeves to just 25 games as the Grizzlies struggled again returning t last place with an NBA worst record of 8-42 in a lockout-shortened season.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1999\/00: Through their first few seasons, the Grizzlies had drawn substantial crowds, but after the lockout, they were hit hard as fans in Vancouver seemed to reject the league after the ugly squabbling wiped out half of a season. Things would go bad to worse on draft day as Steve Francis selected second overall refused to play for a Canadian Team, forcing the Grizzlies to package him in a three-team 11-player deal with the Houston Rockets and Orlando Magic. In return, the Grizzlies would receive Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington, Brent Price, and Austin Carr, along with a couple of draft picks. Francis would go on to win the Rookie of the Year with Rockets while the Grizzlies drowned in red ink, finishing in last place again with a record of 22-60, as rumors of a move south began to circle the team.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2000\/01: Entering their sixth season rumors of a move to the U.S. became a reality as Owner Michael Heisley, decided that it was time for the Grizzlies to move on. After five dismal seasons had given the team-low morale and decreasing support in the community, which put the team in debt. On February 19th, with the Grizzlies buried in last place with a record of 16-36, Heisley traveled to Memphis to discuss a deal between the city and the team, as he applied to move. The NBA would grant the team permission to relocate as the NBA in Vancouver was determined to be a failure after just six years, in which the NBA hampered any chance of them getting early success with their draft lottery rule. The Grizzlies would go on to finish in last place again with a record of 23-59. In their final two games against the Toronto Raptors, the Grizzlies would be swept as they had a 4-7 record in regular-season games against their Canadian rival. In their last game in Vancouver on April 14th, the Grizzlies would be beaten by the Houston Rockets 100-95 as Steve Francis was booed throughout. However, in their final game in Golden State, the Grizzlies would beat the Warriors 95-81 to avoid another 60-loss season. Though the Grizzlies only last six-year hardly giving them a chance to form a strong fan base, it is unlikely that Vancouver will ever get another NBA team after the failures of the Grizzlies.[\/expander_maker]","hint":"","answers":{"5tdj7":{"id":"5tdj7","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Vancouver Grizzlies","isCorrect":"1"},"hwzll":{"id":"hwzll","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Florence Grizzlies"},"akkyy":{"id":"akkyy","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Tulsa Grizzlies"},"xtejm":{"id":"xtejm","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Andes Grizzlies"}}},"a5mjf":{"id":"a5mjf","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"","image":"","imageId":"","video":"","imagePlaceholder":"","imagePlaceholderId":"","title":"What is the Original Location & Name of the New Orleans Pelicans?","desc":"New Orleans Hornets (2002-05)","hint":"","answers":{"fueab":{"id":"fueab","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Oklahoma City Wasps"},"mmhrg":{"id":"mmhrg","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Oklahoma City Pelicans"},"pfj93":{"id":"pfj93","image":"","imageId":"","title":"New Orleans Hornets","isCorrect":"1"},"946xz":{"id":"946xz","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Dallas Hornets"}}},"5m359":{"id":"5m359","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"","image":"","imageId":"","video":"","imagePlaceholder":"","imagePlaceholderId":"","title":"What is the Original Location & Name of the Oklahoma City Thunder?","desc":"[expander_maker id=\"2\" more=\"Read more\" less=\"Read less\"]Seattle SuperSonics (1967-2008)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2007\/08: The season began with the Supersonics being a lame duck team, as talks with the City of Seattle for a new arena had broken down, as Owner Clay Bennett made it known that he would like to move the tea, to his hometown Oklahoma City. On the court, the Sonics had gotten a franchise player with the second overall pick in the NBA draft with Kevin Durant out of Texas. However, with the Ray Allen trade, the Sonics did not have many talents to surround their rookie forward, as they lost their first eight games under Coach P.J. Carlesimo on the way to a 3-14 record in the first month of the season. Things did not get better after that as the clouds of Bennett\u2019s plans to move the team hung over the team all season. Durant would live up to expectations, as he led all rookies in scoring at 20.3 ppg and won the Rookie of the Year. However, the Seattle Supersonics posted a franchise-worst record of 20-62. It would end up being the final season in Seattle, as Clay Bennett ended up getting the right to move the team after settling all the legal issues with the city. In the settlement, Bennett agreed to pay $45 Million to Seattle, with the possibility of owning an additional $30 million is the city is not awarded another NBA franchise by 2013. NBA Commissioner David Stern has expressed a desire to return to Seattle as soon as possible if a new arena is built. If that day comes when basketball returns to Seattle, the team will be called Supersonics, as the settlement required the franchise to leave behind the team\u2019s colors, and nickname, choosing to become the Oklahoma City Thunder.[\/expander_maker]","hint":"","answers":{"fi3pr":{"id":"fi3pr","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Seattle SuperSonics","isCorrect":"1"},"lkfvj":{"id":"lkfvj","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Indianapolis Thunder"},"mycqg":{"id":"mycqg","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Sacromento SuperSonics"},"v0cc0":{"id":"v0cc0","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Idaho Thunder"}}},"0ppdr":{"id":"0ppdr","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"","image":"","imageId":"","video":"","imagePlaceholder":"","imagePlaceholderId":"","title":"What is the Original Location & Name of the Philadelphia 76ers?","desc":"[expander_maker id=\"2\" more=\"Read more\" less=\"Read less\"]Syracuse Nationals (1949-63)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1962\/63: With an aging team, the Nationals were expected to fade, however with the scrappy play of Johnny Kerr, the Nationals remained a strong contender finishing in 2nd place with a record of 48-32.

However, needing a win to advance to the Eastern Finals again, the Nationals would lose two straight games, dropping the decisive fifth game at home in overtime 131-127.
