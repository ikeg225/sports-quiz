Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered a visit to the university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play. He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. When he called the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter redshirting his freshman year in 1980\u201381 because he could not yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981\u201382, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, the North Carolina Tar Heels. Olajuwon averaged 8.3 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.5 blocks, shooting 60% from the field in 18 minutes per game. Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston residents and multiple NBA MVP winners, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every offseason with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: \"The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlajuwon returned from that summer to a different player. He and his teammates (including Clyde Drexler) formed what was dubbed \"Phi Slama Jama\", the first slam-dunking \"fraternity\", so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. In his sophomore and junior years, he helped the Cougars advance to consecutive NCAA championship games, where they lost to North Carolina State on a last-second tip-in in 1983 and a Patrick Ewing-led Georgetown team in 1984. He averaged 13.9 points, 11.4 rebounds and 5.1 blocks in 1982-1983 and 16.8 points, 13.5 rebounds and 5.6 blocks in 1983\u20131984. Olajuwon won the 1983 NCAA Tournament Player of the Year award, even though he played for the losing team in the final game. He is, to date, the last player from a losing side to be granted this honor. Drexler departed for the NBA in 1983, leaving Olajuwon the lone star on the team.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the 1983\u201384 season, Olajuwon debated whether to stay in college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the NBA Draft Lottery was introduced in 1985), the first pick was awarded by a coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: \"I really believed that Houston was going to win the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early).\" His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.[\/expander_maker]","hint":"","answers":{"e9bld":{"id":"e9bld","image":"","imageId":"","title":"University of Houston","isCorrect":"1"},"mnrft":{"id":"mnrft","image":"","imageId":"","title":"UCLA"},"8z2sv":{"id":"8z2sv","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Georgia"},"xk98n":{"id":"xk98n","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Texas Southern University"}}},"hwe9q":{"id":"hwe9q","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"Michael Conroy\/Associated Press","image":"https:\/\/quiz.sportsquiz.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/New-Project-2020-05-29T195333.195.jpg","imageId":"337","video":"","imagePlaceholder":"","imagePlaceholderId":"","title":"Andre Drummond Played For Which College?","desc":"[expander_maker id=\"2\" more=\"Read more\" less=\"Read less\"]Drummond initially declared he would spend a post-graduate year at Wilbraham & Monson Academy in 2011\u201312.

Chamberlain dominated his older college players by scoring 42 points (16\u201335 from the field, 10\u201312 on free throws), grabbing 29 rebounds and registering four blocks.\u2063\r\n\u2063<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn December 3, 1956, Chamberlain made his varsity debut as a center.

Teammate Monte Johnson testified to his athleticism: \"Wilt ... had unbelievable endurance and speed ... and was never tired. When he dunked, he was so fast that a lot of players got their fingers jammed [between Chamberlain's hand and the rim].\" Reportedly, Chamberlain also broke Johnny Kerr's toe with a slam dunk. By this time, he had developed several offensive weapons that became his trademarks: his finger roll, his fade-away jump shot, which he could also hit as a bank shot, his passing and his shot-blocking. Leading a talented squad of starters, including Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, Ron Lonesky and Lew Johnson, the Jayhawks went 13\u20131 until they lost a game 56\u201354 versus Oklahoma State, who held the ball the last three and a half minutes without any intention of scoring a basket, which was still possible in the days before the shot clock (introduced 1984 in the NCAA). As he did at Overbrook, Chamberlain again showcased his diverse athletic talent. He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9 seconds, shot-putted 56 feet, triple jumped more than 50 feet, and won the high jump in the Big Eight track and field championships three straight years.[\/expander_maker]","hint":"","answers":{"6lu1v":{"id":"6lu1v","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Temple\u00a0"},"1smd8":{"id":"1smd8","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Davidson"},"i6yhn":{"id":"i6yhn","image":"","imageId":"","title":"UCLA"},"6x8s3":{"id":"6x8s3","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Kansas","isCorrect":"1"}}},"ddooy":{"id":"ddooy","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports","image":"https:\/\/quiz.sportsquiz.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/New-Project-2020-05-29T195733.496.jpg","imageId":"340","video":"","imagePlaceholder":"","imagePlaceholderId":"","title":"Where Did Victor Oladipo Attend College?","desc":"[expander_maker id=\"2\" more=\"Read more\" less=\"Read less\"]Oladipo chose to play basketball at the Indiana and major in sports communication broadcasting, turning down offers from Notre Dame, Maryland, Xavier and others.

In the 1993\u201394 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was considering redshirting Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man Makhtar N'Diaye violated NCAA rules and eventually transferred to Michigan. Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate Randolph Childress led the Deacons to a 20\u201311 win\u2013loss record. Duncan's style of play was simple yet effective, combining an array of low-post moves, mid-range bank shots, and tough defense. Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature. Despite his heavy focus on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best said, \"Tim [...] was one of my more intellectual students. [...] Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest.\" Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as \"Mr. Spock\", the prototypical logical, detached character from Star Trek.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the 1994\u201395 NCAA season, the sophomore was soon called one of the best prospects among the eligible for the NBA, along with peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace, and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early; however, Duncan said that he had no intention of going pro before graduation, despite the NBA's plan to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. Though it meant passing up a large amount of money, Duncan was loath to deviate from his determination to stay in school. In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against the Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16. Playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but Wake Forest still lost, 71\u201366. Duncan ended the season averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year, and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the 1995\u201396 NCAA season, the Wake Forest team lost Childress, who had graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. In Childress's absence, Duncan led the team to a 12\u20134 record for their ACC season, and a 26\u20136 record overall. The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the Final Four. His season averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game led to another ACC Defensive Player of the Year award and his first ACC Player of the Year award. Although the Wake Forest star was now rumored to be entering the 1996 NBA draft, he stayed in college.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the 1996\u201397 NCAA season, new 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) Demon Deacon and future NBA player Loren Woods eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The 1996-97 team won their first 13 games, but then came a slump, and they failed to win a third ACC title.[7] Later, during the NCAA tournament, Stanford University, led by future NBA point guard Brevin Knight, eliminated Wake Forest with a 72\u201366 win. Duncan finished his senior season with career high averages of 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game while shooting .606 from the field and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for a third straight season. He earned first-team All-American honors for the second time and was a unanimous pick for both the Oscar Robertson Trophy and Naismith College Player of the Year. Duncan was first in the 1996\u201397 NCAA Division I in rebounding, tenth in blocked shots (3.3 bpg), and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg). He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and, based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters, won the 1997 John Wooden Award as the NCAA's best overall male player.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, or Kobe Bryant, Duncan stayed in college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year and a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997 and the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997. In 1996, he led the ACC in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage, and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories. That same year, he was also named Most Valuable Player of the ACC Tournament. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97\u201331 win\u2013loss record and finished his college career as the all-time leading rebounder in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (a mark later surpassed by Kenneth Faried). Duncan left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks\u2014at the time second in NCAA annals behind Colgate's Adonal Foyle\u2014and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn college, Duncan co-authored a chapter in the social psychology book Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors. After earning his college degree, Duncan became eligible for the 1997 NBA draft.[\/expander_maker]","hint":"","answers":{"0tw8q":{"id":"0tw8q","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Georgia Tech"},"36s2o":{"id":"36s2o","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Florida State"},"4g62n":{"id":"4g62n","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Wake Forest","isCorrect":"1"},"59tc9":{"id":"59tc9","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Virginia"}}},"uzsz5":{"id":"uzsz5","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"Via: NBA","image":"https:\/\/quiz.sportsquiz.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/New-Project-2020-05-29T211409.281.jpg","imageId":"344","video":"","imagePlaceholder":"","imagePlaceholderId":"","title":"What College Did Alonzo Mourning Attend?","desc":"[expander_maker id=\"2\" more=\"Read more\" less=\"Read less\"]Mourning played college basketball for the Georgetown University Hoyas.

He began college with no expectations of playing in the NBA, but in Robinson's final two years he was a consensus All-American and won college basketball's two most prestigious player awards, the Naismith and Wooden Awards, as a Naval Academy first classman (senior). In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final. Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under Paul Evans (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and his senior season under former University of Georgia interim Head Coach Pete Herrmann. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the 1987 NBA draft and was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to wait two years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve on active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the Superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent him from serving at sea as an unrestricted line officer, which would be detrimental to his naval career, and might make it impossible for him to receive a commission at all. As a compromise, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman allowed Robinson to train for and receive a commission as a staff officer in the Civil Engineer Corps. As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and was only required to serve an initial active-duty obligation of two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia.

Although he struggled to control his weight, he excelled as a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year. He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with dunks and blocked shots that belied his lack of height and overweight frame. It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and, instead of passing, dribble the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a two-handed dunk. His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname \"The Round Mound of Rebound\" and the \"Crisco Kid\".\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his college career, Barkley played the center position, despite being shorter than the average center.
