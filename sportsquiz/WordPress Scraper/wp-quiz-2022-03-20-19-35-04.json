Leonard was a ninth-grade DB and WR in Riverside, Calif. And the biggest NBA free agent today might've changed the course of pro football forever with his decision not to play it any longer.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was good,\" Leonard told Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News. \"I probably could have gone to the NFL. I just hated practice.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine if Leonard stuck with football -- the sport his cousin Stevie Johnson played for the Bills, 49ers and Chargers. Leonard could've easily been an NFL All-Pro.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard's listed height (6-foot-7) is two inches taller than Calvin Johnson's. He's only nine pounds lighter than Megatron was. His 11.25-inch hands and rebounding ability would've made him a go-to target as a wideout -- or like Tony Gonzalez, Antonio Gates, and other hoops stars before him -- as a super athletic tight end.[\/expander_maker]","hint":"","answers":{"wo6kk":{"id":"wo6kk","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Football","isCorrect":"1"},"nfwef":{"id":"nfwef","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Hockey"},"p3q7w":{"id":"p3q7w","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Soccer"},"fc27x":{"id":"fc27x","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Track and Field"}}},"ttx08":{"id":"ttx08","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"The Star","image":"https:\/\/quiz.sportsquiz.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/New-Project-2020-08-01T115820.912.jpg","imageId":"3267","video":"","imagePlaceholder":"","imagePlaceholderId":"","title":"Who is Kawhi's best friend in the NBA?","desc":"[expander_maker id=\"2\" more=\"Read more\" less=\"Read less\"]As one of the most low-key superstars that the NBA has ever seen, people might be hard-pressed to figure out who Kawhi Leonard\u2019s closest friends are in the league. Although he had an ugly departure from the San Antonio Spurs, Leonard enjoyed a good rapport with his Toronto Raptors teammates, and he seems to have left on good terms. However, his closest relationship isn\u2019t with them, either. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Leonard\u2019s best friend is Jeremy Castleberry, a man who, while not a household name in even the most devout NBA circles, has known Leonard since high school. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy Castleberry is an NBA assistant coach who has been with the Raptors and the Spurs alongside Kawhi Leonard. Much like LeBron James, Leonard has always been big on keeping his friends around as he moves teams, and Castleberry has built a solid reputation along the way. The pair first met in high school, where they played as teammates. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relationship continued in college, where Castleberry joined Leonard at San Diego State. Leonard was the clear star in the team, but Castleberry made his way to the NBA using a different method than his friend, and the two have been joined at the hip ever since.[\/expander_maker]","hint":"","answers":{"g9hhh":{"id":"g9hhh","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Jeremy Castleberry","isCorrect":"1"},"y61pm":{"id":"y61pm","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Paul George"},"182ie":{"id":"182ie","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Kyle Lowry"},"lnvzs":{"id":"lnvzs","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Manu Ginobili"},"gqf9i":{"id":"gqf9i","image":"","imageId":"","title":"Tim Duncan"}}},"yeq7p":{"id":"yeq7p","mediaType":"image","answerType":"text","imageCredit":"Jesse D.
